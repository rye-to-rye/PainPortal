# PainPortal

A chaotic, intentionally frustrating login experience designed to test user patience and sanity.

## Overview

PainPortal is a multi-stage "login" system that throws the user into visual noise, motion, and unpredictable interactions. Every part of the experience is built to waste time, confuse the user, and create maximum friction.

## Features

- Flying username and password boxes
- Submit button that teleports
- Flashing images
- Random password constraints
- A shadow-boxing challenge against a cat
- A final "successful login" screen with a 266-year countdown

## Flow

1. **Chaotic Login Page**  
   Inputs move, buttons dodge you, images flash, and nothing behaves as expected.

2. **Human Verification**  
   The user receives instructions for a shadow-boxing test.  
   They fight a cat.  
   Winning moves them forward. Losing sends them back.

3. **Logged-In Page**  
   If they pass the fight, they reach a confirmation page with a horizontal digital timer counting down from:  
   **266 years**

## Project Motivation

We wanted to push UX to its breaking point and explore how far someone will go to "log in." The project mixes humor, frustration, and chaotic design.

## How to Run
